# unknowncheats-scraped-ui-esp

(Mostly all) scraped images / gifs from unknowncheats.me's largest 3 showcase threads.

* Extremely low quality effort, or non-full images (for example someone screenshotting and drawing on someone else's menu, measuring pixels, etc) were removed, along with some others.
* Memes were mostly kept, duplicates should've all been removed. 


## How it was done
Using Python3 and the BeautifulSoup library, along with the urllib module, I scraped all of the content from each page from the given.

I will probably release my script at some point, I just wanted to host the images somewhere in the meantime.

## Caveats
Some files are named incorrectly, for example "<filename>.jpg.png" due to the way I made the script and I'm too lazy to change that now.
